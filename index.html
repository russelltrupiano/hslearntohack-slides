# Let's talk about HTML

---

## What is HTML?
* HyperText Markup Language
* Markup language - a way of annotating a document so that it is distinguishable from text  
 (eg. marking up paper documents)
* Most recent version is HTML5  
 Main goal was to add support for multimedia (more efficient YouTube videos!)

## Basic formatting/syntax
* Syntax - a set of rules for the ordering of words to create meaning

---

## Try this example in a text editor!
```
<!DOCTYPE html> - Tells your browser what type of file to expect
<html> - Marks the start of the HTML
<head> - Starts the header of the document
    <title>Your Page Title</title> - Sets the title (displayed in browser)
</head> - Ends the header
<body> - Starts the body
    <h1>Heading 1</h1> - Sets a heading of type 1 (largest)
    <p>This is a paragraph</p> - Sets paragraph text
</body> - Ends the body
</html> - Marks the end of the HTML
```

---

## The `<canvas>` tag
* To draw the snake game in the HTML file, we will need to use a `<canvas>` tag
* The tag is a container, or placeholder, for graphics that are drawn using your JavaScript code

* An example is as follows:
```
<canvas id="gameboard" style="border:1px solid #000000;">
</canvas>
```


---

# Basic programming concepts

---

## Comparison operators
* Comparison and logical operators return (are evaluated to) values of either true or false
* For example, the equality operator `==` returns `true` if you type `5 == 4+1`
* *Think about it:* Is this statement true or false?
```(true == false)
```
* Try more examples with this operator at the [JavaScript tutorial site!][js_tutorial]

---

## Comparison operators (cont.)
* Not equal to `!=`
* Greater than `>`
* Greater than or equal to `>=`
* Less than `<`
* Less than or equal to `<=`

---

## Logical operators
* Can be used to combine other conditional statements (such as those we just learned)
* For example, what if you want to do something only if two different equality operators both evaluate to true?
* Use the and operator `&&` which returns `true` if both sides are true
* For example, enclosing statements in parentheses to maintain order of operations: `((5 == 4+1) && (8 == 8))` is true
* *Think about it:* Is this statement true or false?
```((8 == 8) && (5 == 6-2))
```

---

## Logical operators (cont.)
* Or operator `||` evalutes to true if one or both of the statements are true
* Not operator `!` takes one statement as input, evalutes to true if the statement is not true, or false

---

# Learning JavaScript

---

## What is JavaScript?
* The most popular programming language on the web!
* Used to change what displays on a website by modifying HTML content
* Can also add functionality such as validating data (eg. email), etc.

---

# JavaScript in HTML

---

* JavaScript is a programming language for the web, used to program the behavior of the web
* The `<script>` tag is used to denote client-side (runs in your browser) JavaScript

* We can type the code within the `<script>` tags, as below:
```
<script>
\\ YOUR CODE HERE
</script>
```

* However, let's link the file (snake.js) into the HTML file to keep things neat and tidy, as below:
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="snake.js">
</script>
```
