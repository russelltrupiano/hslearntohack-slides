# Let's talk about HTML

---

## HyperText Markup Language
* Markup language - a way of annotating a document so that it is distinguishable from text  
 (eg. marking up paper documents)
* Most recent version is HTML5  
 Main goal was to add support for multimedia (more efficient YouTube videos!)

## Basic formatting/syntax
* Syntax - a set of rules for the ordering of words to create meaning

---

## Try this example in a text editor!
```
<!DOCTYPE html> - Tells your browser what type of file to expect
<html> - Marks the start of the HTML
<head> - Starts the header of the document
    <title>Your Page Title</title> - Sets the title (displayed in browser)
</head> - Ends the header
<body> - Starts the body
    <h1>Heading 1</h1> - Sets a heading of type 1 (largest)
    <p>This is a paragraph</p> - Sets paragraph text
</body> - Ends the body
</html> - Marks the end of the HTML
```

## The `<canvas>` tag
* To draw the snake game in the HTML file, we will need to use a `<canvas>` tag
* The tag is a container, or placeholder, for graphics that are drawn using your JavaScript code

* An example is as follows:
```
<canvas id="gameboard" style="border:1px solid #000000;">
</canvas>
```

---

## JavaScript in HTML
* JavaScript is a programming language for the web, used to program the behavior of the web
* The `<script>` tag is used to denote client-side (runs in your browser) JavaScript

* We can type the code within the `<script>` tags, as below:
```
<script>
\\ YOUR CODE HERE
</script>
```

* However, let's link the file (snake.js) into the HTML file to keep things neat and tidy, as below:
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="snake.js">
</script>
```
