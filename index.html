# Welcome to HSLearnToHack!
We hope you're excited!  
Cause if you're not...  
you will be!

# Introduction
(Insert information about who we are, why we're doing this, and other stuff)

---

## Let's look at the big picture of this project
* What will you be making?
  * Snake (best game ever!)
* What will you learn?
  * Basics of HTML to create webpages  
  * JavaScript to create the actual game

# Let's talk about HTML
The backbone of websites!

---

## What is HTML?
* HyperText Markup Language
* Markup language - a way of annotating a document so that it is distinguishable from text  
 (eg. marking up paper documents)
* Most recent version is HTML5  
 Main goal was to add support for multimedia (more efficient YouTube videos!)

## Basic formatting/syntax
* Syntax - a set of rules for the ordering of words to create meaning

---

## Try this example in a text editor!
```
<!DOCTYPE html> - Tells your browser what type of file to expect
<html> - Marks the start of the HTML
<head> - Starts the header of the document
    <title>Your Page Title</title> - Sets the title (displayed in browser)
</head> - Ends the header
<body> - Starts the body
    <h1>Heading 1</h1> - Sets a heading of type 1 (largest)
    <p>This is a paragraph</p> - Sets paragraph text
</body> - Ends the body
</html> - Marks the end of the HTML
```

---
## Test it out!
* Save the file to an easy-to-access location with the extension `html`  
  (eg. `MyPage.html`)
* Open it in your favorite browser, either by double-clicking on the file or using `File -> Open` from inside the browser
* See the result of your work!

---

## The `<canvas>` tag
* To draw the snake game in the page, we will need to use a `<canvas>` tag
* The `<canvas>` tag is a container, or placeholder, for graphics that are drawn using your JavaScript code

* An example is as follows:
```
<canvas id="gameboard" style="border:1px solid #000000;">
</canvas>
```

# Learning JavaScript
This is where things get fun!

---

## What is JavaScript?
* The most popular programming language on the web!
* Used to change what displays on a website by modifying content
* Can also add functionality such as validating data (eg. email), etc.
* Essentially, it serves to add behaviors to a website

---

## Comparison operators
* Comparison and logical operators return (are evaluated to) values of either true or false
* For example, the equality operator `==` returns `true` if you type `5 == 4+1`
* *Think about it:* Is this statement true or false?
>`(true == false)`
* Try more examples with this operator at the JavaScript tutorial site!

---

## Comparison operators (cont.)
* Not equal to `!=`
* Greater than `>`
* Greater than or equal to `>=`
* Less than `<`
* Less than or equal to `<=`

---

## Logical operators
* Can be used to combine other conditional statements (such as those we just learned)
* For example, what if you want to do something only if two different equality operators both evaluate to true?
* Use the and operator `&&` which returns `true` if both sides are true
* An example of enclosing statements in parentheses to maintain order of operations:
>`((5 == 4 + 1) && (8 == 8))` is true

---
## Logical operators (cont.)

* *Think about it:* Is this statement true or false?
>`((8 == 8) && (5 == 6 - 2))`
* Or operator `||` evalutes to true if one or both of the statements are true
* Not operator `!` takes one statement as input, evalutes to true if the statement is not true, or false

---

## Variables
* A variable is a way to refer to a value, similar to variables in math
* Here is an example of creating a variable, named `x`:
>`var x;`
* We can set it equal to a value, in this case `5`, upon creation:
>`var x = 5`
* Now when you access the variable `x`, you can use the value `5`
>`alert(x);`  
* This code results in a popup box (using the `alert()` function) with 5 as the message

---

## Variables (cont.)
* You can also create a variable using the value of another variable
* *Think about it:* What is the variable `y` equal to after these two lines are executed?
>`var x = 5;`  
>`var y = x + x;`

# JavaScript in HTML
Let's find out how to fit our newfound JavaScript knowledge with HTML!

---

## The `<script>` tag
* The `<script>` tag is used to denote client-side (runs in your browser) JavaScript

* We can type the JavaScript code within the `<script>` tags, as below:
```
<script>
YOUR JAVASCRIPT HERE
</script>
```

* However, let's link the file (snake.js) into the HTML file to keep things neat and tidy, as below:
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="snake.js">
</script>
```
