# Let's talk about HTML

## HyperText Markup Language
* Markup language - a way of annotating a document so that it is distinguishable from text
 (eg. marking up paper documents)
* Most recent version is HTML5
 Main goal was to add support for multimedia (more efficient YouTube videos!)

## Basic formatting/syntax
* Syntax - a set of rules for the ordering of words to create meaning
### Try this example in a text editor!
```
<!DOCTYPE html> - Tells your browser what type of file to expect
<html> - Marks the start of the HTML

<head> - Starts the header of the document
	<title>Your Page Title</title> - Sets the title (displayed in browser)
</head> - Ends the header

<body> - Starts the body
	<h1>Heading 1</h1> - Sets a heading of type 1 (largest)
	<p>This is a paragraph</p> - Sets paragraph text
</body> - Ends the body

</html> - Marks the end of the HTML
```
